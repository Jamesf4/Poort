# Highlevel

The ports need to be opened on your router as well as your Firewall.

# Troubleshooting

**Does [http://127.0.0.1:31400](http://127.0.0.1:31400) work locally for you?**
It should respond "OK FROM PORT 31400". If not, then there is a problem within the computer. Either the port listener docker container is not running, or some firewall is blocking your port.
