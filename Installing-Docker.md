# Docker Desktop

Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise and MacOS users, please install docker desktop. It is the most recent version of Docker. If asked, select "linux containers" - NOT "windows containers". 

Windows must have their "linux subsystem" turn on, in case you have turned it off. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for details.


# Docker Toolbox

Everybody else has to install Docker Toolbox.
