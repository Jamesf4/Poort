# Docker Desktop

Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise 64-bit and MacOS users, please install docker desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). It is the most recent version of Docker. If asked, select to install "linux containers" - *NOT* "windows containers". 

Windows must have their "linux subsystem" turn on, in case you have turned it off. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for details.


# Docker Toolbox

Everybody else has to install Docker Toolbox, from [here](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/). 

## Did Docker Toolbox fail to install?

You most likely need to update something quick on your bios to allow "*virtualization*". 
Specifically, [enable *Hyper-V* in the BIOS](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/step-by-step-enabling-hyper-v-for-use-on-windows-10/ba-p/267945).
