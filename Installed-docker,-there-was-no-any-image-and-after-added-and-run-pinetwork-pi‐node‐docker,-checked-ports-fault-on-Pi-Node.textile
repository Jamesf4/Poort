 set on firewall and port forward on route done, installed WSL, Pi Network Setup 0.4.5 and signed to my cell phone successfully, install Docker Desktop Installer.exe, marked 2 choices: WSL2 and add shortcut, then clicked the Close and Restart, After it restarted, there was no image pinetwork/pi-node-docker. So, searched the image and Pulled and Run it, set Optional settings on page Run a new container, but kept both Volumes and Environment variables empty as I donâ€™t know what I could put into them (please see the attachment). Clicked Run, the new container run successfully and https://pi-mods.de/nodeports/ showed 31401-31403 were opened. After rebooted my serverr, run Pi Node, got "It looks like Docker is correctly installed!" and "Docker daemon is running!". But, Checked

all fault (gray color)! Even same result after turned off the firewall 


Please help me to fix it.

By the way, I tried this few times recently and confused why there was no image pinetwork/pi-node-docker in the docker, then, 1 year ago, there was no the issue. Do I need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux Update?
